# Slowered
a website to share and provide Slowered and it's goods to others

I am developing this on Xamarin Studio 5.7 on OSX 10.8.5

this project will be used primarily for education; a refresher course of .net and noSQL websites. I plan on having a database that contains various projects and related info, inventory for a store, and possibly user login information.

I will likely continue to test my skills by adding various functionality like this to the website.
